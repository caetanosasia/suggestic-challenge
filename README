First install commands (sudo for linux):
    sudo docker compose up --build
    
The application will be running in http://0.0.0.0:8000/

In new terminal search for the image id with the command: 
    docker ps

Execute the image with the command ({id} means the id you get before):
    sudo docker exec -t -i {id} bash

Now you have the bash from the application open, and you can run the migrations:
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
